# Get Old Twitter Back

Hate the new rounded Twitter styling? *For now,* it's controlled by the presence of an `edge-design` class on the `body` element. Remove this, and presto,
Twitter reverts to the old style! This is a single-line userscript that does that.

You'll need a userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) to install it. 

## Tampermonkey Instructions

1. Open up the Tampermonkey dashboard.
2. Go to the [Utilities tab](chrome-extension://dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo/options.html#nav=utils).
3. Paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ternus/old-twitter/master/old-twitter.js` in the 'URL' box and click "Import".
4. That's it!
